#Product API – Express.js CRUD Application

Week 2 Assignment – Server-Side Development (Express.js)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a RESTful API built using Express.js. It provides full CRUD operations for a `products` resource and includes request logging middleware, validation for creating/updating products, global error handling, and optional advanced features like filtering, pagination, search, and stats. The API uses an in-memory array, not a database, as required for this assignment.

## 🚀 Features

### CRUD Operations
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/products` | List all products (supports filtering & pagination) |
| GET | `/api/products/:id` | Get a single product by ID |
| POST | `/api/products` | Create a new product |
| PUT | `/api/products/:id` | Update a product |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Delete a product |

### Advanced Features
- Filter by category → `/api/products?category=kitchen`
- Pagination → `/api/products?page=1&limit=3`
- Search by name → `/api/products-search?name=laptop`
- Product stats by category → `/api/products-stats`

### Middleware
- JSON body parser
- Custom request logger
- Validation for POST/PUT requests
- Global error handler
